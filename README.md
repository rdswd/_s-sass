_s-sass
=======

This is simply https://github.com/Automattic/_s style.css broken up into .scss files. Its purpose is to add another 20 minutes to underscores 1000 hour head start.

There are two files added that are blank that I use in every project:

* _mixins.scss
* _mediaqueries.scss

Feel free to add your sass mixins and your media queries accordingly!
